This directory presents the complete set of numerical simulation results for hydrogen combustion across the investigated parameter space. The tables and figures that follow document the detailed outputs of 128 unique cases, systematically organized by equivalence ratio (φ = 0.5-2.3), pressure (P = 1-100 atm), and mass flow rate/N₂ dilution combinations. For each simulation, the dataset includes: (1) flame temperature (K), (2) major species concentrations (H₂, O₂, H₂O, CO, CO₂, N₂), (3) radical concentrations (H, O, OH), and (4) pollutant formation (NO, NO₂). This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for the machine learning model development and validation discussed in the main text, while also providing a reference for future studies of hydrogen combustion under diluted conditions.
